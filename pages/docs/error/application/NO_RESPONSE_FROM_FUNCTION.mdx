#### Application Error

The application did not respond with a status code, this is due to an error being thrown before the response could be sent.

<Note label={false}>

#### Troubleshoot

- Open the [realtime request logs](/knowledge/where-are-vercel-logs#function-logs) for the application in a separate tab - this tab must be kept open while reproducing the error.
- Repeat the application behavior that led to the error being thrown and review the realtime request logs where it will now show.
- Use the information contained within the error present in the logs to understand where the function is failing.
- Implement [Log Drains](/blog/log-drains) to persist errors from Serverless Functions.
